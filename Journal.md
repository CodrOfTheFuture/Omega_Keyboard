Today is the first day of starting the split keyboard project, named the "Silent Grid". For this keyboard, my whole goal is to add features that I find missing in my current keyboard. I've made a list of things the Silent Grid needs to have for it to be the "perfect" keyboard for me.

Features:
* A slim keyboard, with low profile switches
* A Wireless split keyboard
* Orttholinear layout
* Unique designs
* Hot swabable
* Maybe, an Oled screen
