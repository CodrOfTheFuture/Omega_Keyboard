# OMEGA

### total hours spent: 0.5

## Day 1 - May 22nd

time spent: 0.5

Today is the first day of starting the split keyboard project, named the "Omega Grid". For this keyboard, my whole goal is to add features that I find missing in my current keyboard. I've made a list of things the Omega needs to have for it to be the "perfect" keyboard for me.

Features:
* A slim keyboard, with low profile switches
* A Wireless split keyboard
* Orttholinear layout
* Unique designs
* Hot swabable
* Maybe, an Oled screen

## Day 2 - May 30th

time spent: 0.5 hrs

Now that I know what features I want in my keyboard, I need to know what parts of the keyboard I need to make these features real.

**MCU**: I see lots of recommendations for the **nice!nano v2**. And there's reasons for it. Its super slimm, which fits for my Slim keyboard and it has the nRF52840 chip which is good for bluetooth. In addition, it supports **ZMK** which I will use for my firmware.

**Screen**: For my screen on my keyboard, I will use the **nice!view**. Yes this is a bit expensive but honestly worth it. Its 30hz, draws low power (big win for wireless keyboards), and decent display.

**Switches**: Choosing my switches wasn't hard, I chose the **Red Kailh Low Profile Choc** Switches. They have good ergonomics, sound good, and comfortable to type on.

**Case**: My case will be 3d print, making it easy to make custom designs and cheap.
